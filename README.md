# Understanding-Face-Recognition-Using-Deep-Convolutional-Neural-Networks
Our project aims to gain insights into the mechanisms underlying human face recognition by using specialized CNNs. We conducted experiments that included tasks such as target matching, similarity matching, multi-arrangement, and others. By comparing the performances of CNNs and human subjects on these tasks, we aim to understand the mechanisms that drive human face recognition.


## HOW TO RUN:

1. Access the `Code and Datasets for Experiments` folder, which contains code and stimuli for replicating the paper's results. If the exact stimuli aren't available, we've made every effort to replicate the inferences.

2. Download the necessary stimuli data by following the link provided in the `README.md` file within the `Code and Datasets for Experiments` folder.

3. Run the `Analysis.ipynb` Python script to visualize the results generated by our CNNs.

4. For a complete experience, download the CNN models we trained from the `README.md` file inside the `models` folder.

Training CNNs:

The information and links to the datasets we used to train the CNNs is avaliable on the README.md file inside the folder 'Training CNNs'.

Note:
All the datasets used to train the CNNs and the stimuli images used to replicate the experiments is linked in the repo. Please refer to our report on the results of our study and summary of the original work.
